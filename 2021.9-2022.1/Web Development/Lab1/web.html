    <h3 id="str1">Van Darkholme</h3>
    <p>My name is Van, I'm 30 years old and I'm from Japan. I'm an artist, I'm a performance artist. I'm hired for people to fulfill their fantasies, their deep, dark fantasies. I was gonna be a movie star, you know with modeling and uh acting. After 102 auditions and small parts, you know I decided that I had enough. Then I get into escort work. The clientele requested a lot of um fetishes. So I just decided to go you know full master and change my whole entire house into a dungeon. Um dungeon master, you know with a full dungeon in my house. And uh yep, It's going really well. Fisting is 300 bucks, and uh usually the guy is pretty much high on a popper to get to really get relaxed, you know and I have this long latex glove that goes all the way up to my armpit, and uh then I put on a surgical latex glove just up to my hand. Then just lube it up, and uh it's a long process you know to get your whole get your whole arm up there. But uh, It's an intense feeling for the other person, I think for myself too it's uh, you're going places that um even though its physical with your hand for but, some reason it's also emotional, it's more psychological too. And you know we both reach the same place too it's really strange at the same time. And after a session like that, I get really exhausted from it at the end.

    <h3 id="str2">Billy Herrington</h3>
    <p>His family was very poor when he was young,

        When he was a teenager, Billy studied karate with his father who was a karate coach.
        
        Therefore, the body and muscles become stronger in adulthood.
        
        When he was a student, Billy had studied programming, but eventually failed to become a programmer because his fingers were too thick to press the keyboard.
        
        At the age of 21, he gave up karate because of his father's death.
        
        Came to New York City at the age of 24, turned to the bodybuilding industry, and achieved certain success.
        
        A friend of Billy Harrington sent a picture of him to the "Girls of Flowers" magazine
        
        This photo earned him the "Real Man of the Month" award and a $500 prize awarded by the magazine.
        
        Not only that, but Billy Harrington’s photos in the magazine attracted photographer Jim French
        
        Two years later, Jimmy Franche took a photo of the COLT calendar for him.
        
        Since then, he has stepped into the industry we all know
        
        Eventually became a household name.

        In 2008, Billy Harrington announced his retirement from the well-known film industry and worked in a relative’s construction company.
        
        But this does not mean the end of Billy Harrington's career.
        
        According to Maria's description, Billy also took in many homeless homeless people in California during this period.
        
        
        Billy revealed during his visit to Japan
        
        He majored in programming and studied COBOL and C++ when he was in college.
        
        His father is a karate teacher from Ryukyu. In addition to karate, Billy also learns boxing, wrestling and even martial arts.
        
        However, bodybuilding as the current foundation seems to have begun at the age of 24.
        
        There is also a younger sister who lives in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Billy said that he likes programming and parenting
        
        The most respected Japanese is Miyamoto Musashi (and his favorite Japanese book is his masterpiece "Five Wheels Book"),
        
        The Japanese person I want to meet the most is Ken Watanabe.
        
        
        When Billy visited China, he came to the headquarters of station B to participate in the "most boring live broadcast in history" event jointly organized by station B and Xiaomi.
        
        Accept the interview and break the wrist with the top four owed kings of the up main group.
        
        Due to the blockade of brother-in-law at station B, the video data was basically deleted from the Internet, and the specific situation is no longer known.
        
        On the same day, Billy Harrington also participated in the promotion of the mobile game "Romanship of the Three Kingdoms" and accepted an interview with Tomohiro Yamashita.
        
        In the interview, Billy called his favorite actor Tom Carter (Sekal Swane)
        
        Because I gave it to Tom Carter for the first time in the film...
        
        
        Afternoon of March 1, 2018
        
        Billy Harrington was involved in a car accident at 111 Rancho Mirage Road, California
        
        Sent to Palm Springs Hospital for emergency treatment. He was seriously injured the next day and died at the age of 48.
        
        Buried in Forest Meadow Cemetery in Cathedral City, California
        
        Billy once said before his death that he didn't want to see others crying for him
        
        Hope that his soul, and the souls of the believers who have died, depend on God's mercy and rest and peace.

        Ms. Maria signed a photo for the fans at the scene. Seeing Billy's photo, she was crying with grief, and the surroundings of Billy King originally used for sales were changed to be given away for free.
