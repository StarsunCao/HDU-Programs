# Design and Implementation of Campus Second-hand Trading Platform Based on SpringBoot

#### 介绍
With the development of Internet technology and the change of campus culture, second-hand trading has become a popular trend in campus life. However, there are many problems in the traditional campus second-hand trading model, such as information asymmetry, low transaction efficiency and poor security. For this reason, this graduation design proposes and implements a campus second-hand trading platform based on SpringBoot framework, aiming to provide a safe, efficient and convenient online trading environment for college students through modern Web technologies and intelligent algorithms.
The platform ensures the information security and communication efficiency of both trading parties by introducing a user registration verification system and a real-time communication mechanism. At the same time, it is equipped with functional modules such as commodity search and release, transaction management and evaluation, further enhancing the convenience of the transaction process and user experience. What's more, the system adopts collaborative filtering algorithms to make intelligent recommendations for commodities, accurately matching and pushing potentially interested commodities according to users' browsing and purchasing history, which greatly enriches users' shopping choices and increases the success rate of transactions.
In addition, the platform's backend introduces data visualization technology, providing platform administrators with powerful data monitoring and analysis tools. Through the intuitive charts, administrators can clearly understand the operation status of the platform and effectively guide the platform's strategy adjustment and function optimization. The research and realization of this project not only provides a new solution for campus second-hand transactions, promotes the rational use of resources and the development of campus economy, but also provides useful practical experience and theoretical support for the exploration of the application of information technology in campus life.
